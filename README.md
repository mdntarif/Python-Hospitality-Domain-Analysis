## **Project Title:**

Data Analysis in Hospitality Domain

## **Description:**

The project aims to analyze data in the hospitality domain to understand customer behavior, improve service quality, and increase overall customer satisfaction.

**Steps Involved**:

1. **Understanding the Business Problem**: The project starts by identifying key business challenges in the hospitality sector, such as low customer satisfaction, high churn rates, or identifying the most profitable customer segments. The goal is to use data-driven insights to address these issues.
2. **Data Collection and Understanding**: Relevant data is collected from different sources such as customer reviews, booking records, feedback forms, and transaction details. This data is then explored to understand its structure, types, and relationships between different features.
3. **Data Cleaning and Exploration**: The data is cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies. After cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to find patterns, trends, and correlations.
4. **Data Transformation**: The cleaned data is transformed into a format suitable for analysis. This step includes feature engineering, normalization, and creating new variables that can help in generating better insights.
5. **Collect Insights**: Based on the analysis, actionable insights are generated. For example, identifying factors that lead to positive customer experiences, understanding peak booking periods, or finding out which services are most valued by customers.
